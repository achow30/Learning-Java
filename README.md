Learning-Java
=============
All of the problems I've worked out come from the book "Java - How to
Program" by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel. This repository is for my
benefit only, as it motivates me to complete the problems in the book,
and shows my developing knowledge in the language.

It is not meant to be an answer key, as there are many different ways to
tackle the same problem. This repository only includes my approach to
those problems.

Also, it does not contain the question to those problems, merely the
code that was written to solve those problems.

I am in no way using the contents of this book for my own gain, financial
or otherwise. Nor am I distributing the contents of this book in any way,
shape or form.
